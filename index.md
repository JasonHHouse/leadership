Leadership and Mentorship
---

Leadership is commonly said to be something you're born with. Although, you may have some personality traits that align well, it's been my experience that leadership is an individualized, ever evolving journey. Learning the right techniques, building the right processes, and executing with experiences are critical. 

Mentorship is tightly coupled with leadership. To be the best leader, you have to understand and practice strong mentorship. 

People are excellent at reading BS. Transparency, honesty, and integrity are critical to your leadershp journey. 

I am sharing my journey in leadership and mentorship to grow even more people.

Why am I a good leader? I've led teams at work, in sports, in Boy Scouts, and more. I enjoy the complexity of people and seeing them achive their goals.

| Jason had been my manager and mentor for the past 2 years at Indeed. I have become a better manager and leader with his guidance. Jason showed me his management framework and processes on how to lead my teams effectively. One of Jason’s assets is his ability to listen attentively and offer well-thought-out, timely, relevant advices to help me solve my problems. I also appreciated his candor when it comes to offering feedback and situational assessments (as in he wouldn’t hesitate to tell me that we were in deep s***t). I wouldn’t be where I am today with Jason’s mentorship. | TEMP | TEMP |
